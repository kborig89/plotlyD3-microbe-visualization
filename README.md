# Plotly D3 Microbe Visualization


This is an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

The dashboard uses HTML, JavaScript, D3/Plotly library and json to read in the data.

## Visualizations

1. A horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

2. A bubble chart that displays each sample.

3. A guage to visualize washing frequency.

4. The plots update any time that a new sample is selected.


To run the dashboard open the index.html with a live server.  To change the plots choose a different subject ID in the left hand dropdown.
